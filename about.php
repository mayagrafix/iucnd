        <p class="m-0">Inter University Centre for Nanomaterials and Devices (IUCND) at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) is an inter-university research centre formed by the government of Kerala. The centre is established with a view to provide state of the art infrastructure to support research and development in the domain of nanotechnology and also provide a platform for collaborative research involving academia and industry. Currently about 25 faculty members of various departments of the university associate with the centre to support the academic and research activities of the centre and more expertise will be added through visiting fellow programme. This multidisciplinary platform is expected to promote research towards scalable technologies in the emerging areas of Energy, Communication, Environment and Medicine. By engaging researchers and postgraduate students in its academic outreach programmes such as specialised elective courses, workshops, seminars and internship programmes a new generation of innovators with multidisciplinary talents will be produced. This trained manpower is essential to convert our state and the country a leader in the creation of cheaper and useful technology in energy production, medicine and environmental management. A roadmap for elevating the centre as a design and fabrication centre for nano and micro electromechanical devices, nano-chips and sensor arrays for diagnostic applications and thin film transistors and photovoltaics devices exists which require addition of clean rooms, fabrication facilities such as lithography systems and high resolution electron microscopes. Besides material science it also propose to create a centre of excellence in the development of economically viable therapeutic platforms integrating nanomaterials and medicine for the treatment of cancer and other ailments affecting third world population. An integrated facility with animal houses, tissue culture and toxicology research meeting all the required biosafety and ethical guidelines is also proposed. Currently the centre has expertise in the synthesis of functional nanomaterials for application in the thrust areas. Characterisation facility includes an X-ray diffractometer and Atomic force microscope and other spectrometers.</p>
