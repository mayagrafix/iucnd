"atomic","Atomic Force Microscope","AFM is surface scanning technique which has a sub nanometer scale resolution. It is a powerful technique which can image any type of surfaces like ceramic, polymer, glass and biological samples. Importance of AFM in the research is to analyze surface quality of the functional materials at nanometric level."
"glovebox","Glove Box","Laboratory Glove Box is used in research to create a confined and controlled atmosphere which is an essential condition for experimental works especially while handling sensitive and dangerous materials. It is a sealed container that is designed to allow one to manipulate objects where a separate atmosphere is desired."
"quantum","Quantum Efficiency measurement System","Mainly used for the measurement of solar cell testing and characterization. It helps the Photovoltaic researchers to study the deviceâ€™s design, performance, material band gap, etc."
"solar","Solar Simulator","Solar Simulator is a device which provides artificial sun light illumination approximating the natural sun. The purpose of this device is to provide a controllable indoor testing facility under laboratory conditions. They are widely used in the research areas like photocatalysis, photodegradation, photovoltaic, etc"
"uv","UV-Visible Spectrophotometer","UV-Visible Spectrophotometry technique is used to measure absorbance of light across UV and Visible range of electromagnetic spectrum. This device analyses the functional materials based on the absorption characteristics."
"xenon","Xenon Lamp","Xenon lamp is primarily used as an excitation source which emits photons of a wide range of wavelength. There is a monochromator in the xenon lamp which separates then light into various wavelengths."
"microwave","Microwave Synthesizer","Microwave synthesizers work by exposing chemical reactions to electric fields under high pressure; this rapidly heats the molecules through motion generated either through dipolar polarization or ionic conduction. It can significantly reduce synthesis time for both organic and inorganic compounds in some cases reducing a reaction that would occur over several hours to several minutes."
"mufflefurnace","Muffle Furnace","Muffle Furnaces are used for high-temperature testing applications such as loss-on-ignition or ashing. Muffle Furnaces are compact countertop heating sources with insulated firebrick walls to maintain high temperatures and allows rapid high-temperature heating, recovery, and cooling in self-contained, energy-efficient cabinets."
"rotary","Rotary Evaporator","A rotary evaporator (rotovap) is a device used in chemical laboratories for the efficient and gentle removal of solvents from samples by evaporation. It is also used in molecular cooking for the preparation of distillates and extracts."
"tribo","Triboelectric Measuring System","This is used for measuring triboelectric/piezoelectric measurements. Instrument can vary force of mechanical excitation from 1 N to 10 N and frequency of mechanical excitation from 1 Hz to 10 Hz."
"oscilloscope","Oscilloscope ","Oscilloscope is an instrument that graphically displays electrical signals and shows how those signals change over time. It measures these signals by connecting with a sensor, which is a device that creates an electrical signal in response to physical stimuli like sound, light and heat."
"source","Source Meter","The source Meter is an instrument that can precisely source voltage or current and simultaneously measure voltage and /or current. All into a single tightly synchronized instrument in a compact form factor. It outputs a voltage and measures the current that flows. In this respect, it is just like a bench-top power supply. However, it is programmable and allows the user to sweep the voltage over a defined range."
"probe","Probe Sonicator","Probe Sonicator is commonly used in nanotechnology for evenly dispersing nanoparticles in liquids and for breaking down particles to nano size. Probe sonicator applying sound energy to agitate particles or discontinuous fibers in a liquid. A Sonicator system comprises of 3 main components: generator, convertor and horn."
